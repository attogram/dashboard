# Discord Module

**Note**: This module is not yet implemented.

## Intended Functionality

The `discord` module is intended to fetch and display the number of online members in a specified Discord server.

To use this module, you would need to set the `DISCORD_SERVER_ID` variable in your `config.sh` file. The server must have the public widget enabled for the API to be accessible.

## Current Status

The implementation of this module is currently blocked because a stable, public Discord Server ID with the widget enabled could not be found for development and testing purposes.

If you have a server that could be used for testing, or if you would like to contribute to the implementation of this module, please open an issue on GitHub to discuss it.
